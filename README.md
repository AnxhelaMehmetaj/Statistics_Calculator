Demonstrate inheritance by extending the calculator
Demonstrate encapsulation by having the calculator have methods and a result property
Demonstrate abstraction by layering your code and using static methods. Object methods should call static methods to perform the operation.
Check values for being valid numbers and not strings
Throw an exception for divide by zero
Throw exception for empty list
Use random data for tests and be able to increase the number of calculations required i.e. be able to increase the list of numbers that the mean calculation is done on.
